# Healthy Corner Store Services by Census Tract in Philadelphia

Measuring and quantifying access to healthy food is a hot topic right now in GIS, particularly in Philadelphia. Using the Healthy Corner Store Locations shapefile found on OpenDataPhilly, I created one map of the City of Philadelphia showing census tracts that are over-served and underserved by Healthy Corner Stores, based on the population of each tract.

## Methodology
The resulting map, detailed workflow, and the discussions are [here]().

## This App
This is an interactive map showing census tracts which are over-served and under-served by Healthy Corner Stores ranked by the "service score". This app has the following features:
* Hovering on census tracts, each census tract's population density (2010 Census) will display.
* Clicking on healthy corner stores, a popup showing its name and a link powered by Google Maps to direct you from your current location to this store.
